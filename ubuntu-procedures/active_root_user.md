# Activating the root user account

Use this procedure to activate the `root` user account on your Ubuntu system.

## Important information

By default, the `root` user account is disabled after you install Ubuntu. You just need to set a `root` password using your existing account.

1. In the Bash terminal window, type `sudu passwd root`.

    ````shellscript
    sudu passwd root
    ````

2. Enter a new password for the `root` account, and then press enter.

3. Enter the new password again, and then press enter.

If the operation was a success, you will receive this message.

````shellscript
passwd: password updated successfully
````
